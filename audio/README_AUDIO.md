# Adding Mantra Audio Files
To enable unique audio for each mantra, please download the MP3 files and place them in this `audio` folder.

## Required Files
The app is configured to look for these exact filenames:

1.  **Om Namah Shivaya**
    *   File: `om_namah_shivaya.mp3`
    *   Source Suggestion: [Search on Archive.org](https://archive.org/search.php?query=om+namah+shivaya+mp3) or [PagalWorld](https://www.pagalworld.pw)

2.  **Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya**
    *   File: `om_namo_bhagavate_vasudevaya.mp3`
    *   Source Suggestion: [Search on Archive.org](https://archive.org/search.php?query=om+namo+bhagavate+vasudevaya)

3.  **Om Gam Ganapataye Namah**
    *   File: `om_gan_ganapataye_namah.mp3`
    *   Source Suggestion: [Search on Archive.org](https://archive.org/search.php?query=ganesh+mantra)

4.  **Hare Krishna Maha Mantra**
    *   File: `hare_krishna_mahamantra.mp3`
    *   Source Suggestion: [Krishna.com](https://www.krishna.com/audio) or [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/HareKrishnaMahamantra_201607)

5.  **Rama Hare Krishna**
    *   File: `rama_hare_krishna.mp3`

## How it works
- If the file exists in this folder, the app will play it.
- If the file is missing, the app will automatically fall back to the **Meditation Bell** sound.
